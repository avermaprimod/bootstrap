# [Bootstrap v2.3.1](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap)


This is my first attempt to create a "BootstrapBigToe".  A compile of bootstrap that provides a big bold interface to use in situations or with people with less than "ideal" dexterity.

To get started, checkout [http://getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com)!

Everything stays the same, just swapping in my *.css files makes it bigger and bolder.


## Todo

Some items outstanding to fix (I appreciate all help):

* Better way of publishing this while maintaining integration / upgradability with bootstrap while giving it it's own name to make it easier to find
* Bigger button for "Choose File"
* File name or "No File Chosen" right now is getting cut vertically
* Icons are still the small 14px by 14 px
* Dropdown or drop up icons look good on forms and buttons but are a bit mis-aligned on navbar.
* More testing in responsive layouts
* Test cases for input-* fields
